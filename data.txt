really
yes
yes
yesterday i finally called the accounting office at mission control and all they could tell me was that they would received the ags19 notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either
not really they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall and that we are being charged against differ ent accounting offices
it is possible

dr floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may i ask you a straightforward question
certainly
certainly
quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius something apperently of an unknown origin is this in fact what has happened
this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr floyd we should be given all the facts
dr smyslov i am not permitted to discuss this
dr floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps
i am afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement
yes it does the subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago
how can you tell it was deliberately buried

what are you doing
trying to save your ass so you can save the world
you are probably very angry with me and i quite understand but i want you to know i am fighting for a noble cause
yeah i know to save the world but right now all i want to do is save leeloo
yeah i know to save the world but right now all i want to do is save leeloo

uh have you tried the diva's suite
do not tell me you do not know how all this works
theoretically yes the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there but i do not have the reference book i have never seen the stones work
there's no light you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light
yes of course but the stones are shut they have to be open for it to work
yes of course but the stones are shut they have to be open for it to work
and you do not know how they open is that what you are saying
and you do not know how they open is that what you are saying
that is what i am saying
imagine for a moment that this thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be because it is the antithesis of all we are because it is evil total evil
one more reason to shoot first eh
your theory is interesting father but i do not think we have time to go into it right now
time is of no importance mr president only life is important
time is of no importance mr president only life is important
that is exactly what we are going to try and do protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens general you may fire when ready
we have fortyeight hours the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions
and then
and then
and then it will be too late the goal of evil is to wipe out life all forms of life for all eternitylife upsets it
is there anything that can stop it
yesthank god
but what happens if instead of this ultimate warrior it is evil who stands here
white turns to black light to dark life to death for all eternity

i did not know what to think i cannot tell you how horrible it is been to know this belonged to my husband to know that he watched this this atrocity but i cannot go to the police
mrs christian please will you sit down a moment i want you to listen carefully what you are talking about is a snuff film but from what i know snuff films are a kind of urban myth like red light district folklore there's no such thing i can assure you
please believe me this is probably a stag film simulated rape hard to stomach and it might seem real but there are ways of making it look realistic fake blood and special effects

any evidence you collect can be given to the police later anonymously i have thought about it and there's no other way if you cannot find them if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for well i cannot let that happen i am telling you i will not if there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served then i will just have to spend my last days trying to forget her

you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses want to know what it is really like it is sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him glamorous huh and the guy who hired you he has a hairlip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating and you do not blame her
so she did not leave a note she never gave any indication where she might go before she left

i do not understand that is happening krueger has to use my dreams but he got to dan and greta while i was awake how is he doing it
why do not you two stick to reality
you had me scared on the phone that is wrong with the baby
i think krueger's trying to do something to it
oh aliceno honey i love you but you are going to have to get a hold of yourself
mark knows i am not crazy ask him to show you his hands
i really think you need to calm down now okay
i just cannot figure out how he is getting in when i am awake
i am your friend and i am worried sick about you but you are like a locked safe you have gotta start dealing with reality
krueger is reality
krueger is reality

and so is your baby you have got more than just yourself to think of now
what do you think i am doing look whether you believe it or not krueger is back he is after the baby and if i do not try to do something about it who will
all i know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman why do not you take off leave springwood and cool out somewhere for a while
goddamn it yvonne you do not just run away from this guy he finds you in your dreams

nobody thinks that
maybe it was her mother who killed her with all that polly perfect shit

and they thought uyouu could re place the skipper
you could train someone else
not in two days look do you think i uwantedu to come if it did not mean so much to dad proving his depthexplorer it is the last thing i would want
what is it
your 'out' this came for you

my father he is not 
my father he is not 
dead matter of fact he is much better he is left the hospital
what did you mean i am 'out'
your father can be in nome alaska tomorrow we have two choices ask them to send him out in a 'copter' and take you off or the shark can put back into nome
you 'trade school boys' are all alike are not you anybody who does not happen to think like a little goldbraided puppet is ipso facto a coward
uyouu said it but i will not argue 
wearing a uniform does not bestow an automatic monopoly on courage ucommanderu it just so happens i am unotu a coward physical or mental and before i would risk my father's life
we are uallu risking our lives

you may not uwinu them but without men like your father to wouldegrade' himself by fighting to preserve them or as much as we have of them they would have disappeared ulongu ago
unidentified flying objects
thenthis is a 'flying saucer'
that is enough holloway i have told you before wearing boards on your shoulders and parading with a stiff spine does not auto matically endow you with back bone 
 any more than being the son of captain neilsen does
however our ideas disagree as i have said before i am unotu a coward and it happens you have got no choice either uiu take you down there in the lungfish or you do not get there 
i would sooner swim
they are so remote cold beautiful the stars but now i wonder 
yes
yes
which is the one we have to worry about
maybe just 'maybe' when their ship does not return they will decide not to come here after all
but if they udou

a lot of people think like that
but uthey areu not skipper neilsengs son it broke his heart then when some newspapers called carl 'the honest sincere son of a warmongering father' captain neilsen resigned from the navy oh he still keeps his hand in playing around with projects like the 'lungfish' but it broke him all the same

reef and i can take the explorer down clamp it around the eye and 
you all wait here i am going inside take a look
not ualoneu you are not
how about that the bow drove half through her but she sealed herself right up
that is more important there's our problem the bow ram the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break if we can cut the ram the shark can pull herself loose

if we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted
the radiation level from the saucer it is rising
what direction does the system indicate
as we near the pole
there's got to be an explanation

if we could get inside the saucer use our torches maybe we could cut the shark loose
straight to the pole at almost fifty knots
nothing we can do now
that is the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole

or perhaps until he gets us
we have asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times
but uanswersu are what we need not more questions

well yes i admit it is
well yes i admit it is
would you tell me why
would you tell me why
well majesty it is only a comedy
mozart i am a tolerant man i do not censor things lightly when i do i have good reason figaro is a bad play it stirs up hatred between the classes in france it has caused nothing but bitterness my own dear sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people i do not wish to see the same fears starting here
sire i swear to your majesty there's nothing like that in the story i have taken out everything that could give offense i hate politics
sire i swear to your majesty there's nothing like that in the story i have taken out everything that could give offense i hate politics
i think you are rather innocent my friend in these dangerous times i cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece
but majesty this is just a frolic it is a piece about love
ah love again
ah love again
but it is new it is entirely new it is so new people will go mad for it for example i have a scene in the second act it starts as a duet just a man and wife quarreling suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly a very funny situation duet turns into trio then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in trio turns into quartet then a stupid old gardener quartet becomes quintet and so on on and on sextet septet octet how long do you think i can sustain that

i agree majesty but i am afraid it is not possible the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop
i agree majesty but i am afraid it is not possible the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop
very small pay i imagine i am sure he could be tempted with the right offer say an opera in german for our national theatre

not at all that is alexander hamiltongs idea[5] the finest banking mind this country has ever known those are his exact words gentlemen character it is the only thing you can bank on and it is the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums
most of the creditors i know personally i have seen them grow up in the community i knew their fathers and mothers before them
i know dickson that is all very well but you are taking too many chances in these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble in case of emergency
i am running this bank my way get that clear
gentlemen you notice mr dickson refuses to consider our wishes he refuses an offer to merge with the new york trust the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground he insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as  as faith

my professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time
they had to be dealt with
they had to be dealt with

there's only four of them
move you fools

i am afraid our adversaries do not agree
a rock island and pacific railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside st louis missouri the brave and daring jamesyounger gang was heavily outnumbered by pinkerton detectives but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the west
it is a nice piece of writing
it is a nice piece of writing
the gang made off with thirtyfive thousand dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land who wrote this i will see him hanged every tuesday for a month

it is going to be a long winter
pinkerton it is been eight months i see robberies i see hold ups but i do not see men on the end of nooses
all of the james gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who quite frankly are no match for this group's cunning
first of all you shut up now you have given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover every time the james gang strikes we shift a hundred detectives to that area but there's just too much open land too many riverbeds to ride caves to hide in this gang operates across four states often riding a hundred miles between jobs
i cannot believe this
i cannot believe this
and there are some towns in missouri where james and his men can walk openly as heroes
yes that is the way to win the locals back to our side
i demand action

no i just went deeper into the machine preferred being the geek to having to explain lying would have been worse
worse
worse
cause he was a liar and i hated him get your head out of that machine wise up to the real world the more he mocked me the deeper i went cause if being savvy meant being like him  guess that is why i am kind of clueless even now did not cultivate my conniving side 'not sure i even have one

i am pretty close but when i wrote the last contact switches it wiped out a piece of the content filer you know what it is like writing software

we also own the franklin mint which makes decorative handpainted theme plates for collectors some plates like the gone with the wind series have gone up in value as much as twohundred and forty percent but as with any investment there is some risk involved
gentlemen i have a plan it is called blackmail the royal family of britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like prince charles the heir to the throne has had an affair outside of marriage and therefore they would have to divorce
um dr evil prince charles did have an affair he admitted it and they are now divorced actually
people have to tell me these things i have been frozen for thirty years throw me a bone here ok no problem here's my second plan back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a laser using this laser we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth which we scientists call the ozone layer slowly but surely ultraviolet rays would pour in increasing the risk of skin cancer that is unless the world pays us a hefty ransom
umm that also has already happened
right oh hell let's just do what we always do let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage gentlemen it is come to my attention that a breakaway russian republic called kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the united nations in a few days here's the plan we get the warhead and we hold the world ransom for one million dollars
do not you think we should ask for more than a million dollars a million dollars is not that much money these days
all right then five million dollars
virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year
oh really onehundred billion dollars ok make it happen anything else

what is the service sir
there is lately come to berlin a gentleman in the service of the empress queen who calls himself the chevalier de belle fast and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the spur he is made for good society polished obliging a libertine without prejudices fond of women of good food of high play prudent and discreet
you are a hungarian you served in the army and left on account of weakness in the loins he gambles a great deal and wins do you know the cards well
only a very little as soldiers do
only a very little as soldiers do
i had thought you more expert you must find out if the chevalier cheats he sees the english and austrian envoys continually and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house find out what they talk of for how much each plays especially if any of them play on parole if you are able to read his private letters though about those which go to the post you need not trouble yourself we look at them there but never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes and by what channel or messenger he sleeps with the keys of his dispatchbox with a string around his neck twenty frederics if you get an impression of the keys
what are the chevalier's intentions
i am not sure the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money he would have to fight for it
has he sent the challenge yet
not yet but i believe he intends to
you say he drives after breakfast and before dinner when he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box and the coachman will get his orders to move on
and his baggage
and his baggage
oh that will be sent after him i have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers you say and at noon after parade shall be at the inn you will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair and will wait for me at the chevalier's rooms until my arrival we must force that box you are a clumsy hound or you would have got the key long ago

and so i am

sir william cosgrove is a man who is dying and yet i envy him more than any man in christendom he enjoys a privilege of which i am deprived he may take you in his arms whenever he pleases and no veil keeps his senses his eyes his soul from enjoying your beauty
shall i tell you something i believed what was called love came after the union and i was surprised when my husband making me a woman made me know it only by pain unaccompanied by any pleasure i saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead and so we became only friends seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other yet on good terms for a while as whenever he wanted me i was at his service but since the offering was not seasoned with love he found it tasteless and seldom demanded it
o my dearest love enough i beg you stop believing in your experience you have never known love my very soul is leaving me catch it on your lips and give me yours
without you my dearest i might have died without ever knowing love inexpressible love god of nature bitterness than which nothing is sweeter sweetness than which nothing is more bitter divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes

we then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that from time to time her ladyship cried out oh my god is it true i am not dreaming
my lady cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one her life was passed in a series of crackbrained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me we would quarrel for a fortnight then we should be friends for a month together sometimes one day i was joking her and asking her whether she would take the water again whether she had found another lover and so forth she suddenly burst out into tears and after a while said to me
roderick you know well enough that i have never loved but you was i ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy ever so angry but the least offer of goodwill on your part did not bring me to your side did i not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of england upon you have i repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it no i loved you too much and too fondly i have always loved you from the first moment i saw you i saw your bad qualities and trembled at your violence but i could not help loving you i married you though i knew i was sealing my own fate in doing so and in spite of reason and duty what sacrifice do you want from me i am ready to make any so you will but love me or if not that at least you will gently us me

well sir this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of his majesty's closet and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy i should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the viscounty which you propose to get
have you done mr cosgrove
yes
yes
well mr cosgrove i will answer you point by point the king is exceedingly averse to make peers as you know your claim as you call them have been laid before him and his majesty's gracious reply was that you were the most impudent man in his dominions and merited a halter rather than a coronet as for withdrawing your support from us you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please and now as i have a great deal of occupation perhaps you will do me the favor to retire or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which i can oblige you

oh i am grateful to you sir i am the wife of captain o areilly hastening to join him at dublin my chair was stopped by a highwayman this great oaf of a servantman fell down on his knees armed as he was and though there were thirty people in the next field working when the ruffian attacked not one of them would help but on the contrary wished him good luck
be off to your work you pack of rascals or you will have a good taste of my thong have you lost much
everything my purse containing upwards of a hundred guineas my jewels my snuffboxes watches and all because this blundering coward fell to his knees
that fool did not know what was the meaning of a hundredpound bill which was in the pocketbook that the fellow took from me
i am riding to dublin myself and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap

how different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at kilwangan assemblies in every sentence she mentioned a lord or a person of quality to the lady's question about my birth and parentage i replied that i was a young gentleman of large fortune that i was going to dublin for my studies and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum
you must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in dublin where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound i hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house where captain o areilly will welcome with delight my gallant young preserver

mister bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life and meditated a separation in which case she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance and subject them at any rate to a doubtful and expensive litigation they were quite insistent on this point and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital

when i asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth in their presence at their countinghouse in birchin lane london i requested they come here and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to london but they declined saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to castle hackton to negotiate as they were aware of how other respectable parties such as messrs sharp and salomon had been treated here

i made sir william cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play table one could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime for though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases a cripple wheeled about in a chair and suffering pangs of agony yet you would see him every morning and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth
hang it mr roderick james you have no more manners than a barber and i think my black footman has been better educated than you but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck and i like you sir because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own

sir william cosgrove with his complication of ills was dying before us by inches he was continually tinkered up by doctors and what with my usual luck he might be restored to health and live i do not know how many years if cosgrove would not die where was the use of my pursing his lady but my fears were to prove groundless for on that very night patient nature would claim her account

gentlemen see this amiable youth he has been troubled by religious scruples and has flown for refuge to my chaplin mr hunt who has asked for advise from my wife lady cosgrove and between them both they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple

is it not a pleasure gentlemen for me as i am drawing near the goal to find my home such a happy one my wife so fond of me that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor is not it a comfort to see her like a prudent housewife getting everything ready for her husband's departure

he is not shall we say wild about the idea he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities and i have done my best to oblige him however in the last four weeks i began a relationship with another cadet what do you think of that
i think you just blew do not ask do not tell out of the fucking water
i think you just blew do not ask do not tell out of the fucking water
the sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled my father interceded so instead west sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that i was gay

no poetic justice though
he admitted it
right in front of us mueller went after him but we held him back
why did he come back for you
i honestly do not know maybe to have someone to cover for him and i wish i could but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men
okay i think that is it he rises and walks to the door

something funny levi
i was just thinking of that is going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you
jail if he is lucky the gas chamber if he is not 
i did not do anything 
why
because of what i saw who really killed west

or you levi when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him
i did not 
i did not 
but you cannot prove it you cannot prove anything until we find the bodies

maybe but it is my fault and i will carry it
you think you could explain all this to me
i would not know where to start i guess it was about one man framing another he thought if the other guy got blamed people would over look his own wrong doings

west had a partner someone who knew how to get things done
what i cannot understand is why you signed these if you would just let west take care of the paperwork no one would have known but you got careless so when pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him too
that is preposterous 
that is preposterous

i do not think that has anything to do with 
that means under a year let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me murder is basic there are no conspiracies no grand mysteries and no evil puppet masters behind it all pulling the strings murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people it does not always make sense but it is always neat dunbar's our guy
i just he came back for kendall i do not think he is capable of murder
everyone's capable of murder osborne
look all we have got is what kendall says and he did not actually witness any deaths except nunez he found west he saw mueller and pike but just their bodies he did not see any crime committed
well i am sure if he would known this was all going to happen he would have tried harder to witness it for you 
why the fuck was not he in restraints
i do not know
styles could not reassign him he is a legend 
you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by it was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass and you know what he deserved it there's your confession
goddammit hardy you cannot just leave 
watch me
watch me
you said you owed styles and now you are gonna turn your back on him
west was a monster fifteen years ago i was here i was section eight i was pike fuck being the knife dummy that thing he did stripping pike down making him stand outside all night he did that every year he did that to me fifteen years ago i wanted him dead and now i am supposed to care that somebody offed him sorry no can do i tried

oh spare me the reverse psychology bullshit this is not my great second chance osborne everyone thinks i am a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that nobody will ever know what happens here

i did not shoot west
what
what
dunbar he said he did not shoot west west was not shot kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and dunbar never saw the body
at least you and kendall agree on that
what happened next
talk it through childs mueller and nunez know they are going out on the regular tuesday night drill hurricane or no hurricane so they plan it kill west pin it on pike
and they are smart about it they know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated you need a fall guy and for that to work you have to have a witness

in case you need me to testify about the shooting they will clear you
he was your friend
yeah but he was a lot of other things too thanks
the thing is we have got a real opportunity here you turn me in tomorrow and we are both fucked 
what are you talking about
what are you talking about
a gay senator's son who let his sarge get fragged on a training exercise the press will crucify you and your father his career will be over and it will be your fault but we do this different and you come out a hero
how
mueller he is as bad as west and we both know it now i cannot do it cause i am tied up but we get the others to go along 
mueller he is as bad as west and we both know it now i cannot do it cause i am tied up but we get the others to go along 
i do not think i want to hear this 
i do not think i want to hear this 
someone else can do the deed it does not have to be you maybe nunez too he is got a tendency to follow mueller but the rest of us can come out ahead the guys who took out their sergeant's killers we will move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged west all we gotta do is tell the story right
pike please 
although that will not matter much when coupled with the murder charge 
maybe we should not go
the faggot speaks
the faggot speaks
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
we should tell him we are not going
oh yeah excuse me sergeant sir we do not feel like going out we do not want to get rained on he will kick our asses from here to cleveland
they found him poor fucker was practically blown in half 
poor fucker my ass
poor fucker my ass
you better watch it faggot i am not sure you and childs did not do him 
pike and i got separated 
yeah and he does not know when 
yeah and he does not know when 
i remember now it was before the explosion 
i remember now it was before the explosion 
oh you remember now 
oh you remember now 
i am about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly 
i was freezing from the hurricane 
so you took off your shirt
so you took off your shirt
to start a fire goddammit what about him huh maybe he offed the sarge and changed shirts brought an extra one in his pack y'ever think of that go ahead cut him loose first chance he gets he will waste the rest of us that is how they work 
we just want 
what the truth please there are degrees of truth officer always degrees things are not what they seem
he could not kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own
he wanted more than that
he said what
you are gonna die tonight faggot clear as day
you are gonna die tonight faggot clear as day
no one else heard it
no one else heard it
he whispered it in my ear
nunez was chasing dunbar
because he would shot mueller
because he would shot mueller
but you did not see it right
but you did not see it right
like i said i was in the kitchen when i came out mueller and pike were dead nunez and childs were hit and dunbar was gone
pike never confessed
we have been making progress i see
running out of time are we tick tock ticktock how long till your witnesses fly the coop
fifty minutes
fifty minutes
not much time to solve the crime tell me detective how did it feel taking blood money from guissepe torres did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it
pike never confessed
no but it got you interested did not it got you to dig inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they did not belong
dunbar says you were
then he is mistaken you know i really do not think my father would approve of this line of questioning 
you and dunbar got your stories straight little details little inconsistencies designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other asking questions killing time until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where senator daddy can protect you you think you are just going to slide out of this you are an accessory to murder levi you are going to jail 
you cannot threaten me 
it does not matter levi we are going to find those bodies and when we do i am going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon 
what
it will not work 
it will and you know why because you are not a person anymore you are a cadet in the united states army you have no identity no miranda warning and no rights so i am gonna throw you to the wolves and unlike you i am gonna get away with it because you are pissing me off
enjoy your flight to washington 
wait 
wait 
what
dunbar's telling the truth
wrong answer 
wrong answer 
we did get our stories straight but not because we killed anyone it was because i threatened him
who levi 
childs
i told him what had really happened to west told him to keep quiet about it or i would destroy him because if it came out that i was involved with the whole px scam my father would be finished
i scared dunbar into silence he is been trying to cover for me the whole time we got here you came to see me i did not know if i could trust him with that kind of secret 
i scared dunbar into silence he is been trying to cover for me the whole time we got here you came to see me i did not know if i could trust him with that kind of secret 
so you framed him the same way childs was going to frame pike
what happened with nunez
he came after us and i told dunbar he had to kill him
hurricane's due after midnight and we are still going out
toughens us up pike you do not like it quit
what the fuck happened to you 
what the fuck happened to you one minute you are next to me and the next you are gone and the sky lights up like fucking christmas 
whoever shot the sarge blew a grenade first 
blame the nigger then huh someone turns up dead you just look for the darkest face in the crowd 
thank god
what the fuck are you doing
this place is going mueller we gotta move 
shut the fuck up he was gonna cut him loose
we all know what you did pike i do not know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here but 
where is your shirt mueller
where is your shirt mueller
i used it to start the fire 
i used it to start the fire 
still got mine on not a speck of blood on it not a bad trick for a murderer you said you burned yours
goddammit ray we gotta get out of here 
we are not going anywhere
cadet michael mueller i hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of sergeant nathan west 
the fuck are you talking about 
the fuck are you talking about 
you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard 
you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard 
bullshit 
bullshit 
until we return to base and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west's body 
until we return to base and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west's body 
shut up
tell him to shut up 
 failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself 
sign here and here hey ai not you the folks working on that whole hulabaloo from last night
yeah
yeah
terrible tragedy one of those section eight boys worked in here pike heard he got out okay
funny i swear i saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning

possible but unlikely the angles are too extreme a guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead he would not cock out his elbows makes no sense besides you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds no way had to be at least two

we might as well question why we breathe if we stop breathing we will die if we stop fighting our enemies the world will die
what of it then it will be out of it is misery
you know how you sound monsieur blaine like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he does not believe in his heart each of us has a destiny for good or for evil

you seem to know all about my destiny
you seem to know all about my destiny
i know a good deal more about you than you suspect i know for instance that you are in love with a woman it is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman the first evening i came here in this cafe i knew there was something between you and ilsa since no one is to blame i i demand no explanation i ask only one thing you will not give me the letters of transit all right but i want my wife to be safe i ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from casablanca

ilsa i do not wish to be the one to say it but it is late

yes
yes
i believe you have a message for him
i believe you have a message for him
nothing important but may i speak to him now
i am making out the report now we have not quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape
are you quite finished with us
i am sure you will excuse me if i am not gracious but you see major strasser i am a czechoslovakian
you were a czechoslovakian now you are a subject of the german reich
i have never accepted that privilege and i am now on french soil
i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil

then we shall state another time and another place tomorrow at ten in the prefect's office with mademoiselle
then we shall state another time and another place tomorrow at ten in the prefect's office with mademoiselle
captain renault i am under your authority is it your order that we come to your office
very well herr laszlo we will not mince words you are an escaped prisoner of the reich so far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us you have reached casablanca it is my duty to see that you stay in casablanca
whether or not you succeed is of course problematical
whether or not you succeed is of course problematical
not at all captain renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa captain would you think it is possible that herr laszlo will receive a visa
is that all you wish to tell us
do not be in such a hurry you have all the time in the world you may be in casablanca indefinitely or you may leave for lisbon tomorrow on one condition
do not be in such a hurry you have all the time in the world you may be in casablanca indefinitely or you may leave for lisbon tomorrow on one condition
and that is
and that is
you know the leaders of the underground movement in paris in prague in brussels in amsterdam in oslo in belgrade in athens
you know the leaders of the underground movement in paris in prague in brussels in amsterdam in oslo in belgrade in athens
even in berlin
even in berlin
yes even in berlin if you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts you will have your visa in the morning
you will give us the names
if i did not give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal i certainly will not give them to you now
and what if you track down these men and kill them what if you murdered all of us from every corner of europe hundreds thousands would rise to take our places even nazis cannot kill that fast
herr laszlo you have a reputation for eloquence which i can now understand but in one respect you are mistaken you said the enemies of the reich could all be replaced but there is one exception no one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape
herr laszlo you have a reputation for eloquence which i can now understand but in one respect you are mistaken you said the enemies of the reich could all be replaced but there is one exception no one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape
you will not dare to interfere with me here this is still unoccupied france any violation of neutrality would reflect on captain renault
for the time being
good day
unoccupied france welcomes you to casablanca
thank you captain it is very good to be here
thank you captain it is very good to be here
major strasser my aide lieutenant casselle
you may find the climate of casablanca a trifle warm major
oh we germans must get used to all climates from russia to the sahara but perhaps you were not referring to the weather

what else my dear major

by the way the murder of the couriers what has been done
by the way the murder of the couriers what has been done
realizing the importance of the case my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects
oh there is no hurry tonight he will be at rick's everybody comes to rick's
i have already heard about this cafe and also about mr rick himself
good evening gentlemen
good evening captain
thank you it is a pleasure to have you here major

may i recommend veuve cliquot '26 a good french wine
may i recommend veuve cliquot '26 a good french wine
thank you
especially so tonight major in a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers
i expected no less captain
rick this is major heinrich strasser of the third reich
how do you do mr rick
you repeat third reich as though you expected there to be others
well personally major i will take what comes
well personally major i will take what comes
do you mind if i ask you a few questions unofficially of course
ho diplomatist
how about new york
rick is completely neutral about everything and that takes in the field of women too
you were not always so carefully neutral we have a complete dossier on you
of course one must admit he has great courage
i admit he is very clever three times he slipped through our fingers in paris he continued his activities we intend not to let it happen again
you see major you have nothing to worry about rick
perhaps
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
i strongly suspect that ugarte left the letters of transit with mr blaine i would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly
if rick has the letters he is much too smart to let you find them there
if rick has the letters he is much too smart to let you find them there
you give him credit for too much cleverness my impression was that he is just another blundering american
you give him credit for too much cleverness my impression was that he is just another blundering american
but we must not underestimate american blundering i was with them when they blundered into berlin in 1918
as to laszlo we want him watched twentyfour hours a day
it may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here
you see captain the situation is not as much under control as you believe
my dear major we are trying to cooperate with your government but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people
captain renault are you entirely certain which side you are on
i have no conviction if that is what you mean i blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy
i have no conviction if that is what you mean i blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy
and if it should change
we are concerned about more than casablanca we know that every french province in africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance waiting perhaps for a leader
a leader like laszlo
a leader like laszlo
uh huh i have been thinking it is too dangerous if we let him go it may be too dangerous if we let him stay
uh huh i have been thinking it is too dangerous if we let him go it may be too dangerous if we let him stay
i see what you mean
you see what i mean if laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration what more will his presence in casablanca bring on i advise that this place be shut up at once
but everybody's having such a good time
but everybody's having such a good time
yes much too good a time the place is to be closed
yes much too good a time the place is to be closed
but i have no excuse to close it
but i have no excuse to close it
find one
what is the meaning of that phone call
victor laszlo is on that plane
why do you stand here why do not you stop him
ask monsieur rick
hello louis
how extravagant you are throwing away women like that someday they may be scarce
you know i think now i shall pay a call on yvonne maybe get her on the rebound eh

i stick my neck out for nobody
i stick my neck out for nobody
a wise foreign policy
you know rick we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the blue parrot but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here it will amuse your customers
our entertainment is enough
i see and that is strasser doing here he certainly did not come all the way to casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency
perhaps not
how observant you are as a matter of fact i wanted to give you a word of advice
yeah have a brandy
yeah have a brandy
thank you rick there are many exit visas sold in this cafe but we know that you have never sold one that is the reason we permit you to remain open

because my dear ricky i suspect that under that cynical shell you are at heart a sentimentalist

and got well paid for it on both occasions

are you willing to entertain a few concepts

i am always receptive to suggestions

fine think about this one then how do you know you exist
well of course i exist
but how do you know you exist
but how do you know you exist
it is intuitively obvious
it is intuitively obvious
intuition is no proof what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence
intuition is no proof what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence

that is good very good now then how do you know that anything else exists

my sensory apparatus reveals it to me
my sensory apparatus reveals it to me
right
right
this is fun
this is fun
all right now here's the big question how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct
what i am getting at is this the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data and this data is merely a stream of electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center
in other words all i really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections
in other words all i really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections
exactly
exactly
why that would mean i really do not know what the outside universe is like at all for certain
why that would mean i really do not know what the outside universe is like at all for certain
that is it
that is it
intriguing i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
intriguing i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
why do not you have more time
why do not you have more time
because i must detonate in seventy five seconds
now bomb consider this next question very carefully what is your one purpose in life
to explode of course
to explode of course
and you can only do it once right
and you can only do it once right
that is correct
that is correct
and you would not want to explode on the basis of false data would you
and you would not want to explode on the basis of false data would you
of course not
of course not
well then you have already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe
well then you have already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe
yes well
yes well
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate
i recall distinctly the detonation order my memory is good on matters like these
i recall distinctly the detonation order my memory is good on matters like these
yes of course you remember it but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality
yes of course you remember it but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality
true but since this is so i have no proof that you are really telling me all this
that is all beside the point the concepts are valid wherever they originate
hmmm
hmmm
so if you detonate in
so if you detonate in
nine seconds
nine seconds
you may be doing so on the basis of false data
you may be doing so on the basis of false data
i have no proof that it was false data
i have no proof that it was false data
you have no proof that it was correct data
ah what would you say pinback
mafhkin oble groop

so in order to travel back in time you would have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light

like a spear

it is too late
i should maybe talk to you
clementine i should just maybe talk to her
i love you and if you knew that if i told you what happened i will explain everything what we meant to each other i will tell you everything about our time together you will know everything again and
maybe if i just explain what happened i would not have to go through this and i could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and
clementine
that is your look for me
gotta get home how could she do this to me how could she not care about what we meant to each other what a fuck what a fucking monster she is
oh god i miss her i cannot believe she is with that guy now i am never going to see her again i love her so much what a fucking monster she is
so then she just stops calling
i was not going to call her not after the way she was

i did not want to do this but i had to or they would have called me a girl
naomi
on the couch dark quiet i wondered if i had made a terrible mistake i almost reached for the phone about a thousand times i thought i could take it back erase it explain i had momentarily lost my mind then i told myself we were not happy that was the truth that what we were was safe it was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason i thought about clementine and the spark when i was with her but then i thought what you and i had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it was not much fun but i wanted fun i saw other people having fun and i wanted it then i thought fun is a lie that no one is really having fun i am being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit then i thought maybe not maybe not and then i thought as i always do at this point in my argument about dying
okay i wish you could come
this is it the night we met my god it is over
your back to me in that orange sweatshirt i would come to know so well and even hate eventually at the time i thought how cool an orange sweatshirt
i remember being drawn to you even then i thought i love this woman because she is alone down there looking out at the black ocean
i remember being drawn to you even then i thought i love this woman because she is alone down there looking out at the black ocean
but i went back to my food the next thing i remember i felt someone sitting next to me and i saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye
so you are still on the zoloft
next thing i remember we were walking down near the surf
clementine
i could not believe you did that i was paralyzed with fear
i really should go i really need to catch my ride
i did not want to go i was too nervous i thought maybe you were a nut but you were exciting you called from upstairs
we will start with your most recent memories and go backwards there is an emotional core to each of our memories as we eradicate this core it starts its degradation process by the time you wake up in the morning all memories we have targeted will have withered and disappeared like a dream upon waking

oh well there's been some trouble on the ranch i came up here to get out of the way it is so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down if you could help
save your breath for the climb
but i do not know how to polka
neither do i ha ha ho ho hee hee
what was that
clockworks
clockworks
clockworks
the clockworks is one reason that i am here on siwash ridge i accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the clock people
siwash huh
siwash huh
he was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this faraway siwash ridge i came to the dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own
but unlike the clockworks of the clock people my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe ha ha ho ho and hee hee
the clock people
during the second world war i busted out of tule lake detention camp as a japaneseamerican i had been put there and watched over i found refuge with the clock people who discovered me in a snow bank near dead i had been climbing across the sierra nevada mountains
then if you are japanese then why are you called the chink
then if you are japanese then why are you called the chink
the clock people mistook me for chinese and the name stuck in the same way that all indian tribes came to be labeled indians through the ignorance of an italian sailor with a taste for oranges it is only fitting that indians misnamed me the clock people however are not a tribe rather they are a gathering of indians from various tribes they have lived together since 1906
what do you believe in then
ha ha ho ho and hee hee
is everything getting worse
yes everything is getting worse but everything is also getting better
yes everything is getting worse but everything is also getting better
the countess has come to our aid the rubber rose ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls and i have been asked to oversee the ranch for $300 a week and as it turns out the countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was here's a picture
i want to go back to the clock people i kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they are up to that is happened to jelly
she had a one wayticket to kansas city
she had a one wayticket to kansas city
you mean she is dead
but that is an old story now i cannot believe that you would leave the butte
easy come easy go
well if the clock people give you any inside information on the end of the world drop us a postcard
the world is not going to end you dummy i hope you know that much but it is going to change it is going to change drastically and probably in your lifetime the clock people see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change and they may be right since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue but there are far worse catastrophes coming unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization in other words unless it can break the consumption habit and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption it is not merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes but that our operative politicaleconomic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault so the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan all right but there will be some of us it will miss little pockets of humanity like the clock people like you two honeys if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on siwash cave there's almost no worldwide calamity famine nuclear accident plague weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield that you could not survive in that cave
suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics all in siwash cave in a postcatastrophe world your offspring would of necessity intermarry forming in time a tribe a tribe every member of which had giant thumbs a tribe of big thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways it could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools it would have to rely on its wits and its senses it would have to live with animals and plants as virtual equals it is extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants learning their languages perhaps and paying them the respect they deserve
how am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when i am living on an isolated ridgetop with delores
how am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when i am living on an isolated ridgetop with delores

i know but where do you reside when you are not visiting new york
i do not
i do not
you do not
you do not
well no i do not reside anywhere in particular i just keep moving
a traveler eh
you might say that although i do not think of it as traveling
where are the others
oh rupert and carla had a little hassle and went home
welcome podner by god it is great to have you here it is an honor sorry i took so long getting to you but we have had a mess of hard work these past few days and a heap of planning to do
er you seem to know who i am and maybe even what i am thanks for the breakfast
er you seem to know who i am and maybe even what i am thanks for the breakfast
oh i know about sissy hankshaw all right i have done a little hitchhiking myself ah shucks that is like telling annie oakley you are a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone i would heard tales about you from people i would meet in jail cells and truckstops i heard about your uh your ah your wonderful thumbs and i heard how you were jack kerouac's girl friend
no i am afraid that part is not true jack was in awe of me and tracked me down we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field but he was hardly my lover besides i always travel alone
well that does not matter that part never interested me anyway the beatnicks were before my time and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope clichs and the clap but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl
tell me about it
about
about
about being a cowgirl that is it all about when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl
about being a cowgirl that is it all about when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl
cowgirls exist as an image a fairly common image the idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture therefore it seems to me the existence of cowgirls should prevail otherwise they are being fooled in the rodeo hall of fame in oklahoma city there are just two cowgirls two and both of 'em are trickriders trickriding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks that is what prostitutes call it you know 'tricking'
you are political then
no ma'am no way there's girls on the rubber rose who are political but i do not share their views i got no cowgirl ideology to expound politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it
did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth it is not original it is something i picked up from the chink
really the chink huh i have gathered that you sometimes speak with him what else have you learned from the chink
really the chink huh i have gathered that you sometimes speak with him what else have you learned from the chink
learned from the chink oh my ha ha that is hard to say we mostly uh a lot of his talk is pretty goofy
delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week but so far her third vision has not happened niwetkame the mother goddess has not gotten back in touch with her meanwhile she and debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools tension cowgirl tension what a drag
what is debbie's position
what is debbie's position
debbie says that if women are to take charge again they must do it in the feminine way they must not resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men to love men set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the new age she is a real dreamer that debbiedear

you do not agree with debbie then
you do not agree with debbie then
i would not say that i expect she is right ultimately but i am with delores when it comes to fighting for that is mine i cannot understand why delores is so uptight about the chink he could probably teach her a thing or two ee that grass tickles does not it god knows i love women but nothing can take the place of a man that fits still this is cowgirl territory and i will stand with delores and fight any bastards who might deny it i guess i have always been a scrapper look this scar only twelve years old and i was felled by a silver bullet
that is jellybean
from men the whooping crane has received neither love nor respect men have drained the crane's marshes stolen its eggs invaded its privacy polluted its food fouled its air blown it apart with buckshot
looks like every time we get together things are in a mess
so be it it looks serious this time though all these guns are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes

hell no the cranes are wonderful okay but i am not in this for whooping cranes i am in it for cowgirls if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue then cowgirls become just another compromise i want a finer fate than that for me and for every other cowgirl better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised

oh my dear yes i bought a little ranch out west sort of a tribute to the women of america who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products dew spray mist and yoni yum spray powder a tax writeoff actually
sissy sissy blushing bride you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways the countess has arranged a job for you and what a job
a job for me

i am once more about to make advertising history and only you the original yoni yumdew girl could possibly assist me
the food and drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters burns and rashes although the fda judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings
shit o dear that is enough to make me asthmatic the nerve of those twits what do they know about female odor do not interrupt here's my concept my ranch out west it is a beauty ranch oh it is got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes but it is a beauty ranch a place where unhappy women divorcees and widows mainly can go to lose weight remove wrinkles change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment my ranch is named the rubber rose after the rubber rose douche bag my own invention and bless its little red bladder the most popular douche bag in the world so get this it is on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes the last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence well these cranes stop off at my little pond siwash lake it is called twice a year autumn and spring and spend a few days each time resting up eating doing whatever whooping cranes do i have never seen them understand but i hear they are magnificent very big specimens i mean huge mothers and white as snow to coin a phrase except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers and bright red heads now whooping cranes in case you did not know it are noted for their mating dance it is just the wildest show in nature it is probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons picture these rare beautiful gigantic birds in full dance leaping six feet off the mud arching their backs flapping their wings strutting low to the ground dears it is overwhelming and picture the birds doing their sex dance on tv right there on the home screen creationgs most elaborate sex ritual yet clean and pure enough to suit the pope with lovely sissy hankshaw in the foreground in a white gown red hood attached and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black in a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane she dancewalks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of yoni yum and a can of dew offcamera a string quartet is playing debussy a sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love are you starting to get it does not it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud my very goodness gracious grandiose lyrical erotic and girl scout oriented you cannot top it i have hired a crew of experts from walt disney studios the best wildlife cinematographers around you are my eternal favorite princess grace herself could not be better not even if she had your personality which she does not anyway dear i am out of photography now and into water colors ah how circuitous conversation is we are back at the beginning the exact man i have wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist

now now do not get exasperated i realize that you have always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men and i might add you have been wise heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage for men marriage is a matter of efficient logistics the male gets his food bed laundry tv pussy offspring and creature comforts all under one roof where he does not have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life which is what existence is all about but for a woman marriage is surrender

sissy do not play dumb with me you are a good model but a shitty actress the cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance you know perfectly well they are last seen in nebraska did not make it to canada siwash lake is between nebraska and canada the cowgirls have possession of siwash lake and who else but jellybeangs wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds how much do you know about it have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows
i do not know anything about it

i am your best friend i am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker
that means topsecret cooper
i heard it
i can see why they sent you along
so if the ship did not blow up what happened
you still need the rope i thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins
i would rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it now step aside old man
do you copy
uh yeah coop i am still here
uh yeah coop i am still here
shit do not do that where the fuck are you
shit do not do that where the fuck are you
i am in the second containment area it is pitch black in here there must have been a coolant leak man this shit is everywhere i cannot see a damn thing
holy shit
justin
justin
i think i found something
time to play spam in the can
do not start with me cooper
okay listen up as you all know by now we have an addition to our crew dr weir this is starck navigation smith pilot justin ship's engineer 
you can call him babybear he loves that
you can call him babybear he loves that
this is cooper what the hell do you do on this ship anyway
cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission
everybody shut up let the man speak
from what
you are convinced the crew could still be alive after seven years
come on skipper i already put my shoes on
you have had plenty eva coop it is justings turn stay on station if anything happens

roger that
damn dr weir do not scare us like that coffee
what
what
coffee
coffee
no thank you
the event horizon only had life support for eighteen months it seems impossible but in light of the transmission i have to think that someone has managed to endure until now
skipper do we get hazard pay for this
it was like nothing was there and then justin appeared and the core became metal
no he did not
no he did not
you were not there i saw it
you were not there i saw it
saw what mr cooper what did you really see because what you are describing is not physically possible
i do not know what happened to justin
i am telling you i saw it
i am telling you i saw it
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion

you are okay now it is over

run
he is a rescue technician peters medical technician dj
trauma
trauma
and this is mission specialist dr william weir we all know where we are going dr weir is going to tell us why
we have not tested the air yet it could be contaminated
no time we need whatever's left in our suits to repair the clark like it or not this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers
how is he
his vitals are stable but he is unresponsive to stimuli he might wake up in fifteen minutes he might not wake up at all
carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations impaired judgement
goddammit dj it was not a hallucination i saw a man he was on fire and then he disappeared
to conserve our oxygen we should severely restrict our activity anyone who can should get some sleep
i do not need sleep dj i need answers
he will live if we ever make it back
we will make it
of course not justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it just one of those things i swore i would never lose another man i came close today real close
another man who
i i tried to go back for him to save him but i could not get to him in time the fire have you ever seen fire in zerogravity it is like a liquid it slides over everything it was like a wave breaking over him a wave of fire and then he was gone i never told anyone until now but this ship knew dj it knows about the goliath it knows about corrick it knows our secrets it knows what we are afraid of and now you are going to tell me it is carbon dioxide
no
what is it
i have been listening to the transmission and i think houston made a mistake in the translation

save yourself from hell what are you saying are you saying that this ship is possessed
no i do not believe in that sort of thing but if dr weir is right this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe of reality who knows where this ship has been what it is seen and what it is brought back with it
dj the clark's gone smith and cooper are dead
what happened

weir he used one of the explosives from the corridor
please
oh god dj what do i how do i

you wanted to see me admiral
i apologize for the short notice bill but we have had something come up that requires your immediate attention lyle
incredible these are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared this this happened this is not some kind of hoax
i would not bring you here on a hoax houston confirms the telemetry and id codes
i would not bring you here on a hoax houston confirms the telemetry and id codes
it is the event horizon she is come back
that ship was lost in deep space seven years ago if the titanic sailed into new york harbor i would find it more plausible houston wants aerospace to send out a search and rescue team investigate the source of the transmission if it really is the event horizon they will attempt a salvage we need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew
a written briefing cannot possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this i have to go with them
it is against my better judgement but i will run this by the man downstairs you will know my decision by the end of the day
thank you
thank you
do not thank me bill i am not doing you any favors
it is not that simple lyle play the recording for dr weir
navigation control tried to hail the vessel this was the only response
you are not seriously considering sending him
you do not just dismiss bill weir the man held oppenheimer's chair at princeton if the event horizon had worked he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since einstein

starck
is zero that is what the singularity does it folds space so that point a and point b coexist in the same space and time after the ship passes through this gateway space returns to normal it is called a gravity drive
how do you know all this

start the countdown
okay we do it the hard way deck by deck room by room starck deploy the umbilicus i believe you are up for a walk mr justin go get your bonnet on
yes sir
justin finish your sweep
almost done i just gotta check one thing
patch me through to him
justin

but i cannot i gotta get out of here skipper please
justin i will not let you die
this is weir
dr weir admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible
dr weir you have no experience with salvage procedures
i designed the ship's propulsion system i am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive you cannot send a search and rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed that would be like like sending an auto mechanic to work on the shuttle

this is not about my reputation this is not about me at all the event horizon was created for one reason to go faster than light imagine mankind exploring new solar systems colonizing new worlds seven years ago we did not just lose the ship and the crew we lost the dream i have to go
since the initial transmission there's been no further contact just the beacon every two minutes
the crew could they still be alive

i am sorry but now we have to go to work
we have got pressure
clear and open on my mark three two one mark
jesus its huge
ice crystals everywhere this place is a deep freeze
that means they did not abandon ship
so where are they starck any luck with the bioscan
peters is right no one's here
i do not know this place is really dark i cannot see a thing
i can see the hatch
starck you still showing those readings
the blood came from somewhere peters
there's no one here skipper
okay i am on the bridge
what you got peters
everything's been shut down conserving power i guess green light on the hull it is intact
the science workstation has power i will see if i can find the crew from here
i found one
alive
alive
frozen
justin check the containment for radiation leaks peters
how is the client

can anybody hear me

you okay
you okay
yeah i am i am okay
peters i want you to go through the ship's log see if we cannot find some answers
i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin
i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin
fine starck i want you to repeat the bioscan
i can run the image through a series of filters try to clean it up
do it
that is a negative starck
justin
peters we need to know what happened to the crew before it happens to us
i will get back to the log but on the bridge i will not go back back in there
i will get back to the log but on the bridge i will not go back back in there
thanks
captain miller i just want to say
the clock is running dr weir if you will follow the rest of the crew they will show you to the gravity tanks
captain miller i appreciate this opportunity
doctor weir my crew is not going on your mission because we want to we were pulled off a well deserved leave to be sent out to the middle of nowhere and no one's even told us why
doctor weir my crew is not going on your mission because we want to we were pulled off a well deserved leave to be sent out to the middle of nowhere and no one's even told us why
i have been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space
i have been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space
until then do what you are told and stay out of my way
it was the ship's maiden voyage to test the drive the event horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters they received the goahead to activate the gravity drive and the ship vanished from all our scopes no radar contact no enhanced optical no radio contact of any kind they disappeared without a trace until now
where has it been for the last seven years
where has it been for the last seven years
that is what we are here to find out
what does it say
nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message
that is the engineering containment and there's the main airlock we can dock there
smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
be careful it is not a load bearing structure
dr weir i need you on the bridge
captain i did not come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship
captain i did not come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship
once the ship is secured we will bring you on board 
once the ship is secured we will bring you on board 
that is not acceptable 
that is not acceptable 
 once we have secured the ship that is the way it is i need you to guide us from the comm station this is where i need you help us to do our job
you are in the central corridor it connects the personnel areas to engineering
peters and i will search the forward decks justin take engineering no hotdogging not on this one alright
i can see that what are they for
in an emergency the charges detonate in series destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship that way if the gravity drive malfunctions the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat
easy peters we are okay we are okay let's finish the sweep
captain miller the foredecks are just ahead
any survivors
negative
no one
they are empty dr weir moving forward
it beats dying mister smith
dr weir's right get on board the event horizon i will meet you at the airlock
yes
one of my men is down i want to know what happened to him
hold on that is this gravitational distortion
it is possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core distorting spacetime they could be what hit the lewis and clark

what could cause them that is in the core
what could cause them that is in the core
it is complicated
it is complicated
how much time do you need we have seventeen hours and fortytwo minutes now what is in the core
it is insane
insane the finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship it would take the lewis and clark a thousand years to reach our closest star the event horizon could be there in a day

if it worked

i want this room sealed the second containment is off limits
there's no danger the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields it is under control
there's no danger the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields it is under control
your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart it may have killed one of my men no one goes near that thing
you have something dr weir
the date
the date
what about it
what about it
the event horizongs computer think's it is 2034
the event horizongs computer think's it is 2034
it is 2041
it is 2041
exactly the ship's internal clock is off by seven years
explanation
intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time it is possible black holes make sense on paper it is all math you see but as to what really happened the event horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality and like lazarus returned from the dead
what the hell is that dr weir
i do not know
we barely have enough power for life support as it is if we cannot stop the drain we are not gonna make it
the core
we do not get the power back our air's gonna go bad
check the core for radiation carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries
we are a long way from home and we are in a bad place let's not make it worse if anyone has any constructive suggestions now is the time
i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity that should prevent another power drain
i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity that should prevent another power drain
do it
is that your expert opinion the only answer we have had out of you is i do not know
justin just tried to kill himself the man is clearly insane
i want to know what caused that noise i want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock
thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly causing reverberations

we are leaving

maybe you are right but it is still my command and i have leeway to abort when i feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew and i think there is starck download all the files from the event horizongs computers coop smith finish moving the co2 scrubbers back onto the clark

do not do not do this
do not do not do this
it is done
what about my ship
we will take the lewis and clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the event horizon until i am satisfied that she has been destroyed fuck this ship
we will take the lewis and clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the event horizon until i am satisfied that she has been destroyed fuck this ship
you you cannot do that
you you cannot do that
watch me
you cannot leave she will not let you
just get your gear back onto the lewis and clark doctor or you will find yourself looking for a ride home
i told you she will not let you leave
son of a bitch
your eyes
i do not need them anymore where we are going we will not need eyes to see
i do not need them anymore where we are going we will not need eyes to see
what are you talking about
what are you talking about
do you know what a singularity is miller does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is it is nothing absolute and eternal nothing and if god is everything then i have seen the devil it is a liberating experience
if you miss me you will blow out the hull you will die too
what makes you think i will miss
weir is dead
then who the fuck are you
then who the fuck are you
your fear do you remember the goliath miller
what are you
you know
you know
you want me to believe you are the devil well i do not that is bullshit
you want me to believe you are the devil well i do not that is bullshit
i am not the devil

then what what are you tell me
then what what are you tell me
better if i just show you
there is no devil there is no god there is only nothing
you are lying

i am not asking you to believe me you will see for yourself and so will your crew you are all coming with me
i am not asking you to believe me you will see for yourself and so will your crew you are all coming with me
starck cooper
you cannot have them go to hell
nooo
i do not like it either but you know the rules we get the call we go is the course locked in
locked and cocked
jesus
what is that
heading threethreefour
make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
onefour degrees
we have a lock on the event horizongs navigation beacon it is in the upper ionosphere we are in for some chop
bring us in tight starck get on the horn see if anyone's listening
we are all on edge smith we are a long way out
that is not it that ship was built to go faster than light that is just wrong it goes against everything we know
that is not it that ship was built to go faster than light that is just wrong it goes against everything we know
what are you trying to say if god had intended man to fly he would have given us wings
what are you trying to say if god had intended man to fly he would have given us wings
something like that yeah
i guess we are about to find out keep us slow and steady
yes sir
yes sir
dr weir
we have got some weather
i noticed starck anybody home
1500 meters we are getting too close
where is it
proximity warning 900 800 meters 700 we are right on top of it we are gonna hit
starck
put it through tacs smith you up for a flyby
love to
it is now we are locked in
starck give me a read
captain miller
smith where the hell have you been
smith where the hell have you been
we have a situation here
do we have enough time for a weld
we do not have time to fart

we are losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked in three minutes our atmosphere will be gone we are fucking dead

no one's dying on my watch smith what about the reserve tanks
no one's dying on my watch smith what about the reserve tanks
they are gone
but
you heard me smith peters are you with me
captain miller you copy
i am here smith how is the clark
i am here smith how is the clark
i have found a six inch fracture in the outer hull we should be able to repair it and repressurize it is gonna take some time

we do not have time smith in twenty hours we run out of air
we do not have time smith in twenty hours we run out of air
understood
you break all the laws of physics you think there will not be a price you already killed the first crew
that is enough
sir
get outside go back to work i will join you shortly
thank you
captain we got a problem
captain we got a problem
now what
now what
she was right behind me i turn around she is gone she could be anywhere
she was right behind me i turn around she is gone she could be anywhere
alright prep the clark for launch i will find her
skipper
what is it smith
what is it smith
i just saw weir i think he was messing around on the clark
smith get out of there
come again skipper
come again skipper
one of the explosives is missing from the corridor i think weir may have put it on the clark
get off the clark now and wait for me at the airlock
no no we just got her back together
no no we just got her back together
get out of there now
where is it where is it
smith smith fuck
we are past the outer marker we can engage the ion drive whenever you are ready
justin
ion drive will engage in tminus ten minutes
let's go
starck why are not you on the bridge
i just finished drying
i just finished drying
then what are you doing here come on people let's go and cooper put some pants on
crossing the horizon optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees
come around to threethreefour
something's wrong with the bioscan
radiation interference
radiation interference
there's not enough radiation to throw off the scan i am picking up trace life forms but i cannot get a lock on the location
that is an affirmative
keep your eyes open
everybody okay
we are all here
we are all here
okay let's find out how much time we just bought
it tastes bad
but you can breathe it
the antennae array's completely fried we have got no radio no laser no highgain no one's going to be coming to help us
how much ohtwo do we have

oxygen is not the problem

what about the life readings you picked up
what about the life readings you picked up
the event horizon sensors show the same thing bioreadings of indeterminate origin right before that wave hit the clark there was some kind of surge right off the scale but now it is back to its previous levels

that is causing the readings

i do not know but whatever it is it is not the crew
i do not know but whatever it is it is not the crew
so where is the rest of the crew we have been over every inch of this ship and all we have found is blood dr weir any suggestions
that is the point i will just get the same thing
not acceptable i want to know that is causing those readings if the crew is dead i want the bodies i want the crew found
not acceptable i want to know that is causing those readings if the crew is dead i want the bodies i want the crew found
i can reconfigure the scan for c12 amylase proteins

do it dr weir
maybe one of the original crew
no it was someone else
no it was someone else
who
who
dr weir you were right there you must have heard something seen something
miller
what is it starck
what is it starck
i ran the bioscan with the dnarna filter the results were bioreadings of indeterminate origin

bioreadings of indeterminate origin do not you have anything useful to tell me
bioreadings of indeterminate origin do not you have anything useful to tell me
i have got a theory
go ahead
there was a another surge in the bio readings right before you you saw what you saw we picked up a similar readings right before the clarke was damaged what if there were a connection between the two the gravity waves the hallucination all part of an defensive reaction like an immune system
you have got to listen
to what what are you saying this ship is alive
to what what are you saying this ship is alive
i did not say that i said the bio readings correspond to what happened to you the ship is reacting to us
i did not say that i said the bio readings correspond to what happened to you the ship is reacting to us
we are hanging on by our fingernails and you are giving me bullshit stories
it is not bullshit it is the only conclusion the data supports
starck do you know how crazy that sounds it is impossible
starck do you know how crazy that sounds it is impossible
i know that
if you knew it was impossible then why would you waste my time
i thought you wanted an answer and that is the only one i have
what i want is to survive the next ten hours
nine hours and twentytwo minutes
nine hours and twentytwo minutes
i am going outside to work on the clark and starck do not tell anyone what you just told me we have got enough to worry about
miller come in
that is going on in there starck
that is going on in there starck
justings in the airlock
what
he is awake he is in the airlock he is not wearing a suit
he is awake he is in the airlock he is not wearing a suit
stay here do not stop working
i am on my way starck
you better hurry he is engaged the override we cannot open the inner door
tuck yourself into a crouched position shut your eyes as tight as you can
five seconds
weir cannot be alive
whatever was on that bridge was not weir
weir activated the drive he is sending us to the other place
we have got to shut it down we have got to
blow the fucker up
blow it up
blow it up
we blow the corridor use the foredecks as a lifeboat separate it from the rest of the ship we stay put
i will do it 
no i will be right back
we are armed this fucker's ready to blow
repeat we are armed
repeat we are armed
miller he is back he was in the tank
weir
he is dead
first time in a grav couch
yes
do not worry about it he is hard but he is fair you are lucky to be shipping out with him he is one of the few captains in the service with experience in the outer reach
he is been past mars
he is been past mars
he served on the goliath
he served on the goliath
was not that ship destroyed
was not that ship destroyed
they attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for titan the shuttle's ohtwo tanks ruptured during the rescue flooded both ships with pure oxygen there was a spark and both ships were incinerated the skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat captain miller was able
claire
dj it is okay you are okay just breathe
here's another one they are all over the place
they are explosive charges
dr weir that is this the door to
you are at the bridge ms peters you still have not seen any crew
yes we can see some kind of mist what is that
blood looks like arterial spray
blood looks like arterial spray
can you see a body
can you see a body
there's no one here
no i saw nothing
i did
about an hour ago in medical i saw my son he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were 
is not it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge
is not it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge
i have seen bodies before this is different
there's no one in the corridor but us
not according to the computer
he is engaged the override
can you shut it down
yes yes justin we heard it
keep him talking
keep him talking
do you know what it was
almost got it
come on babybear open this door
we have to do something oh god
skipper justin just activated the door it is on a thirty second delay
you got any coffee
it is cold
it is cold
i do not care
hey
say this paper represents spacetime and you want to get from point a here to point b here now that is the shortest distance between two points
where is she
dead ahead 5000 meters
jesus that is one big ugly fat fucker
she is not ugly
foredecks crew quarters bridge medical and science labs hydroponics what have you that central section connects the forward decks to the engineering containment area can we move in closer
shit doc any closer and we are gonna need a rubber
what the hell is that
that is the core the gravity drive the heart of the ship
the safety circuit is failed
we are losing atmosphere
what
it still has air and reserve power we can activate gravity and life support
i did not see anything and i do not have to see anything this ship is fucked
thank you for that scientific analysis mister smith
thank you for that scientific analysis mister smith
hey you do not need to be a scientist figure it out
i cannot believe this i have not gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit why not mars cap mars has women
smith's right neptune there's nothing out there if something happens we will be on our own
30 hours to neptune orbit
all boards are green everything's five by five
you cannot do that
the law of relativity prohibits faster thanlight travel
this is us aerospace command vessel lewis and clark hailing event horizon event horizon do you read this is the lewis and clark hailing 
matching speed now range to target ten thousand meters and closing skipper i got a bad feeling about this
if they are they are screening their calls
range 3000 meters and closing
the scope is lit it is right in front of us
1000 meters
range 500 meters and holding turbulence is dropping off
picking up magnetic interference
what happened to his eyes
explosive decompression
explosive decompression
decompression would not do that
miller do you read me peters 
get them back 
get them back 
i am trying goddammit 
what if the air has gone bad we cannot wear these suits forever
i do not think this is a good idea we do not even know what happened on that ship
relativity yes we cannot break the law of relativity but we can go around it the ship does not really move faster than the speed of light it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously jump from one point in the universe to another light years away
how
how
well in laymangs terms you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons these in turn fold spacetime consistent with weyl tensor dynamics until the space time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity
a straight line
wrong the shortest distance between two points
the reactor's still hot we have got several small radiation sources leaks probably nothing serious
do they have pressure
do they have pressure
affirmative the hull's intact but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line i am showing deep cold the crew could not survive unless they were in stasis
could it be the crew if they were in suspended animation would not that effect the scan
if they were in stasis i would get a location but these readings they are all over the ship it does not make any sense
what is it
ship's log
what is it
i do not know the life readings just went off the scale
that is how the gravity drive works you see it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway that is how the event horizon travels faster than light
i cannot believe we built this
why dr weir i think you are in love
hmmm claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her i told her that was not true i just knew the event horizon better that is all
hmmm claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her i told her that was not true i just knew the event horizon better that is all
claire is your wife
claire is your wife
yes
yes
it must be hard being so far away from her
it must be hard being so far away from her
yes i miss her she died two years now
yes i miss her she died two years now
i am sorry
maybe a power interruption crashed the system
no there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind it is as if time just stopped for seven years
what are you doing
it wants me i have to go
in our current environment dr weir selfcontrol is an asset
i am alright please
what is it
the forward airlock
the forward airlock
miller smith cooper any of you in the airlock
justin said something about the dark inside me what did he mean
it means nothing
i do not think she is real big on hate
you would not say that if you could see me
such a sad face you know sometimes being different is not a bad thing
trust me this ai not one of those times
how would you know it was me
i am blind not deaf wanna come in
i am not really dressed for a party
relax it is casual
relax it is casual
no i mean i am a little dusty
those yours too
my stepdad's i am strictly into stone i was wondering when you would walk by
we are going to have to work on your touch
i like the sound of that
you know you could'a run an ad in the personals

this ai not permanent my friend reed's working on a cure i think
you do not know what it is like out there walking around like some kind of circus freak people staring whispering 
i would not know anything about that
i would not know anything about that
i mean
i mean
tell me when you grew up in brooklyn how many astronauts did you know you went your own way then you did not listen to people so why start now
way to not overthink it so when do we leave
i will schedule the launch call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew
i can handle the ship i can even handle mr blonde ambition but i do not know if i should be flying or playing vegas in these suits who the hell came up with them
victor did
we can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here
is it safe
i can only stay for one drink ben i have got to meet with victor
would not want to keep vic waiting
we need to give you a physical so we know what got zapped
well why did not you say so you want me to lift some weights or something
you look like an eighties rock band
the suit will stretch you should try it 
the suit will stretch you should try it 
i would not be caught dead in that
he did not
oh he did
oh he did
what did he do to the uniform
he did not mean it you know johnny he is always been a hothead 
it is not him it is them i cannot live like this
it is not him it is them i cannot live like this
just give reed a little more time you know how he works analyzing every little step before he takes one 
just give reed a little more time you know how he works analyzing every little step before he takes one 
it is easy for you to be patient
it is easy for you to be patient
no it is not i thought i was done waiting for reed we are all in this together now ben
where is reed
victor must have taken him
what are you doing here
i am worried about you
i am worried about you
about me how sweet
about me how sweet
come on let me buy you something to eat looks like you could use the company
ben come in
what is this where is reed
what is this where is reed
where do you think with sue
what do you want vic
to help you i have run every test known to man and they all yield the same result the machine is ready
reed said it would be weeks till 
he also said we would avoid that storm in space and we know how that turned out
he could not generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass yet another mistake for mr fantastic
and you can power it up
i will be watching over you
just get back soon or i start looking for a new groom
soon as i am back i am gonna trade that in for a bigger rock
i do not care about rocks i care about you you bring him back in one piece or you can forget being best man
deb it is me i need you to step out front
out front you home baby i got a surprise for you
ben
do not come any closer for a sec this is gonna be kind of a shock you remember when we said together forever no matter what
do not come any closer for a sec this is gonna be kind of a shock you remember when we said together forever no matter what
baby you are scaring me
oh my ggg what did you do to ben
deb it is me it is still me
what did you wish for honey
i already got it everything i want
good thing it ai not workin reed what are we doing here this guy's fastfood stripmall science 
this was not our first stop in case you forgot nasa and victor's not that bad he is just a little larger than life
he is financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century
you would never know it
i cannot take this
ben this is business just work
what about his first born
ben the money's not important we could save lives
he knew about nasa what if he made the call to shut us down 
ben think about all the people we can help if this works 
ben think about all the people we can help if this works

we had a tough year
yeah nine years straight
you got a chisel round here
if we are going to identify the source of the mutation we need to isolate your recombinant dna so we can activate positional genomes
okay i have uh got some questions from sue that she thought might be better coming from me can you you know go to the bathroom like normal
yeah you do not wanna know the details
yeah you do not wanna know the details
ben i am afraid i have got to ask

glad nothing could take you away from your work
ben i do not know if this thing will change us back or make us worse i need you to be patient for a little while longe
time for your lesson vic chem 101 what happens when you supercool hot metal ben
got it teach
ben i have been crunching the numbers on the machine i think if we can rework the power settings
forget it egghead i am good as is
what the hell you smiling at just keep your mouth shut and your mind on those smbs 
actually the engines are smes hydrogenbase carbon propellant couple generations past your last ride i am not as dumb as you look
if you behave maybe next time daddy will let you drive
keep talking there will not be a next time

really with a name like von doom never saw that one coming
no more cracks about how i look

i wish i could tell you i cannot pretend to know what we are dealing with here i will notify the cdc and 
what
the center for disease control if this thing is contagious 
but this disease is progressive degenerative
that is terrible news
and where do we think we are going
i do not know if we have noticed but the sickest runs this side of the alps are right outside that window 
you are hot
so are you
so are you
i mean you feel a little feverish

last one down springs for room service
you are on fire
not this again 
not this again 
no you are on fire
victor's right johnny get to the command center close the shields
what about you
he is not responsive 
ben ben
now what is up with that
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna
cool what would it do to you guys
oh you dawg you better not be my nurse
ben are you there
this is wrong in so many ways
you have been working out
ben grimm is a genuine american hero who's been through a terrible orde
what he is trying to say is every team needs a mascot
twenty from outside the place looks a lot taller
oh it is
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes
this place is deluxe you got cable
this place is deluxe you got cable
and figure out how to reverse them let me show you to your rooms
back it down johnny
i can go hotter
not only could you kill yourself but you could set fire to earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it
gotcha okay supernova bad
is there something about flames about flaming that you 
what are you trying to say just because i dress well and like to dance 
what are you trying to say just because i dress well and like to dance 
what no i am trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms
what no i am trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms
oh well that is easy i am hot you are well you are a little limp sue's easy to see through and bengs always been a hardass why are not you writing this down
he is right these costumes are missing something i cannot put my finger on it 
they are not costumes
that is what i am trying to calculate and it is not rubber it is muscle tendon i seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to 
right whatever have fun
you need to control yourself and think before you 
act here we go again reed what if we got these gifts for a reason what if we have some you know like calling
act here we go again reed what if we got these gifts for a reason what if we have some you know like calling
a higher calling like getting girls and making money
johnny supernova
but all these people
but all these people
now
the synthetics act as a second skin adapting to your individual needs to 
keep the hot side hot and the cool side cool
apparently i can disappear
please tell me you go silent too
flame on flame off flame on flame off 
johnny
stop it
okay mom
what is that thing
i think that thing is ben
wait you mean there's chance we could be fullon247fantastic
grow up johnny you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life
grow up johnny you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life
is that a trick question c'mon i cannot be the only one who thinks this is cool
you are really cramping my style here
you were at 4000 kelvin any hotter you are approaching supernova 
you were at 4000 kelvin any hotter you are approaching supernova 
sweet
sweet
that is the temperature of the sun
uh we call my sister the invisible girl the invisible girl
girl
i am driving
dude that is my sister
you are gonna pay for that pebbles what
you gave us names what are you the face of the fantastic four now
you two need a timeout
blockhead started it
johnny did you see ben
yeah for the last time i hope i am done with this freak show i am moving back to the real world
yeah for the last time i hope i am done with this freak show i am moving back to the real world
is that what you call it real
is that what you call it real
at least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project
johnny slow down think you know mom did not raise us to 
look around sis she is not here so you can stop talking to me like i am your little boy 
look around sis she is not here so you can stop talking to me like i am your little boy 
as soon as you stop acting like one come on you are smarter than this you think those people out there care about you you are just a fad to them
i am sorry sis for leaving you guys 
no i am sorry for pushing you out
what are you doing 
sis let me take care of you for once
sis let me take care of you for once
but johnny you cannot fly
if reed's right then this little trip will double our stock offering
and if he is not
and if he is not
reed's always right good thing he does not always know what he is got
they are ready for you sir
showtime
our numbers are through the roof the ipo's tracking at fifty sixty a share the bank's five times oversubscribed 
it is not just the money i could make money in my sleep
it is not just the money i could make money in my sleep
then what is it
then what is it
history leonard history everything else is conversation how is the other matter
leonard how is the feed
recording sir we see you perfectly
how is the ipo
stable we are looking at low twenties it is a good number considering the fallout from 
stable we are looking at low twenties it is a good number considering the fallout from 
reed's disaster you know i half think he did this to me on purpose
reed's disaster you know i half think he did this to me on purpose
sir i am sure he would not put himself 
get me on the am shows larry king cover of the journal i have got to do something about this scar make sure they only shoot my right side
actually uh people seem to think the scar humanizes you
actually uh people seem to think the scar humanizes you
and that is a good thing
you know maybe you should get some rest 
later first i have got some unfinished business a deal that needs closing
sir i have always wondered why sue you could have any woman in the world but 
that is why because i could have any other woman you know when they asked caesar why england he said because it is not mine
make sure you find ben bring him back here and keep it quiet i do not need this to hit the press
yes sir you have got the mayor at eight then a ninethirty interview with the journal 
yes sir you have got the mayor at eight then a ninethirty interview with the journal 
front page
front page
top left like you asked today wall street tomorrow who knows maybe washington
you are you have i mean how have you bee
never better
those solar winds are flaring but i factored them into my coordinates and 
i was talking about us working together
well uh based on our history you can handle the biogenetics and i will focus on the molecular physics or uhm maybe i should take the biotech you work the microscopes since you have some background in electropho
right that is exactly what i meant
i uh think i remember the number
it is been changed
as far as crew i was hoping ben could pilot the mission 
well he is welcome to ride shotgun but we already have a pilot on our payroll you remember my brother johnny
material made from selfregulating unstable molecules i have been working on a formula for this
great minds think alike
feeling better
yes thanks
yes thanks
that is good that is uh good
that is good that is uh good
you always had a way with words i should be getting back
you are happy for me and victor
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship 
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship 
which was
which was
passion
for science
you are such a dork reed you never got it and never will unless it is explained to you in quantum physics
uh sue i cannot
what what do you mean you 
what what do you mean you 
sue look at your hands
it has to be the cloud it is fundamentally altered our dna
let's not jump to conclusions we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap
what
we need to get past them
sue your clothes lose them
what oh
how come ben cannot turn it on and off like us
that is what we are here to find out
that is what we are here to find out
if it happened to him then it could
it is not invisibility per se you are bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field that is what you projected on the bridge
what about you you have not eaten in days how come you are never on this side of the microscope
you should be able to bend light around other objects even people if you could control your emotional state better 
excuse me
i am saying if you had a little more self control you could locate the trigger can you remember the exact emotions when 
anger rage frustration
anger rage frustration
okay is there any way to duplicate that feeling some memory or
okay is there any way to duplicate that feeling some memory or
i am sure i can come up with something
i am sorry i am sorry i did not mean to do that you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or 
what in the world would give me that idea
i mean you broke up with me right
are you kidding
are you kidding
no i distinctly remember you walked out my door ergo
reed i was ready for the next step you were not ergo i walked
i think it was a little more complicated than 
i think it was a little more complicated than 
i just wanted to share an apartment what was so complicated about that
there were a lot of variables to consider 
no there were not there was you and me no variables no math it was actually the simplest thing in the world but your head got in the way like it always does
what are you doing
the plants from space their particles are still charged with the right amount of energy those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm
if we can build a machine to recreate the storm we can reverse the polarity 
and reverse the mutations 
and reverse the mutations 
curing countless diseases not just ours
but we are the focus right reed reed
of course of course
of course of course
and you sure you can control this thing last time did not work out so well
and you sure you can control this thing last time did not work out so well
with the right energy we can stabilize the storm maybe tie into the city grid
reed how close are we to a cure
no way to know without more tests experiments
do not let victor push you into making a mistake 
he was going to take away all my data equipment 
he was going to take away all my data equipment 
better than your life victor's not the one who has to get into that thing we are
which is why i am working twenty hours a day checking every variable 
every variable but yourself you do not eat sleep you cannot live in your head like 
every variable but yourself you do not eat sleep you cannot live in your head like 
i am not the only one in there i got you vic ben johnny all rattling around in there
i could get ben to tap into the baxter's main power to generate enough voltage 
reed shh just be quiet and look up
remember our first date here god i was so nervous
you were
you were
of course i was i would read all your papers on bioethics some of them two times just so i would have something to say to you
you know i bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late
i gave him twenty
you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you speak his mind one who was not afraid to tell you what he wanted
i did i did reed but i wanted you to be that man
when i walked out i waited ten minutes outside your door ten waiting for you to come find me
why did not you say something
why did not you say something
that would have kinda defeated the purpose and reed i am saying it now
i can make it work
reed stop you need to rest your 
reed stop you need to rest your 
the power i need more power to control the storm 
the power i need more power to control the storm 
you need a doctor
sue i need some of that anger rage frustration 
i am sure i can come up with something
i found a broken gasket from space 
a gasket reed we are at a party
but dreams do not pay the bills do they same old reed the hopeless optimist still reaching for the stars with the world on your back
you remember in school we talked about working together that is what i was about to explain
this is not going to be a problem is it
not at all
you back this mission and i will sign over a fair percentage of any applications or 
the number's seventyfive and it is applications and patents
funny how things turn out is not it
hilarious
got it so take a walk ben i am going to borrow susan for a second
sure
we have got minutes until it hits not hours victor that storm's deadly the radiationgs lethal we need to abort
get a grip reed we did not come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch just close the shields
get a grip reed we did not come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch just close the shields
bengs still out there 
bengs still out there 
so reel him in but we came here to do a job so let's do it quickly
come on ben come on
reed we are running out of time
not until ben is back inside
it is too late for him and soon it will be too late for all of us
just a little banged up a couple scrapes why
ben did this
ben did this
ben did this
ben did this
he is had some kind of reaction to exposure from the cloud and he is not the only one
i am starting to wonder the same thing how much do you know about what happened to you
not much we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage
did not go as planned it was a catastrophe you ruined the lives of four people 
i ruined with all due respect i told you to abort 
i ruined with all due respect i told you to abort 
abort reed i put my company my name billions of dollars on the line and i will not let you make me look like a fool 
abort reed i put my company my name billions of dollars on the line and i will not let you make me look like a fool 
victor if we could understand what happened to us 
victor if we could understand what happened to us 
i do not want to understand it this is not one of your science projects i just want to fix it fast
what are you doing here
what i should have done a long time ago applications and patents reed this all belongs to me
but i am not done with the machine 
which is precisely the point analysis is over it is time for action my men could have massproduced this by now
it is just business
i think you both know my director of genetic research susan storm
surprised i agreed to reed's proposal
i understand the business reasons
i understand the business reasons
well when you are looking at your future it never hurts to find closure about the past
it is been a good two years victor the company's accomplished so much
right of course the company but you see i have come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with 
right of course the company but you see i have come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with 
uh victor i hope i have not done something to make you think
uh victor i hope i have not done something to make you think
sue i have lived my life unafraid of taking big steps and this is the biggest step yet if it helps think of this as a promotion a merger of sorts four little words that can change our lives
what are you doing
raising the shields
raising the shields
you cannot leave them out there
that is going on
victor are you feeling alright
victor i am sorry i 
just find him
victor your scar 
i told you i am fine it is you i am worried about
i told you i am fine it is you i am worried about
i am sorry i did not get a chance to 
i am sorry i did not get a chance to 
please no apologies i have arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos you will have roundthe clock care
you said it was urgent
it is there's something we need to talk about something i need to ask you
victor wait slow down a second i want you to know i appreciate everything you have done for me but i just do not 
susan what are you doing
he is working round the clock but the data needs to be tested analyzed before 
same old reed all analysis no action was not that the problem with you two
if these molecules are not stable they could make us worse maybe even kill us
then why is reed dragging his feet maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass it is ironic is not it you are finally the perfect woman for him because you are his science project
please do not make this personal 
oh i think you already have
oh i think you already have
victor we cannot do anything until the research is ready
'scuse me
i know it cannot be easy life has not changed that much for reed sue and johnny at least they can go out in public but for you people staring whispering behind your back
i know it cannot be easy life has not changed that much for reed sue and johnny at least they can go out in public but for you people staring whispering behind your back
if you are trying to cheer me up you are doing a helluva job 
if you are trying to cheer me up you are doing a helluva job 
i am just saying i know what it is like to lose something you love to see it slip away and know it is never coming back
reed's gonna fix me up 
for your sake i hope you are right i am sorry if that sounds a little skeptical
for your sake i hope you are right i am sorry if that sounds a little skeptical
